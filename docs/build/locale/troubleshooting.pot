msgid "If it can't find ``jupyter``, you may need to configure your ``PATH`` environment variable. If you don't know what that means, and don't want to find out, just (re)install Anaconda with the default settings, and it should set up PATH correctly."

msgid "There's a special fallback for the Python kernel: if it doesn't find a real kernelspec, but it can import the ``ipykernel`` package, it provides a kernel which will run in the same Python environment as the notebook server. A path ending in ``ipykernel/resources``, like in the example above, is this default kernel. The default often does what you want, so if the ``python3`` kernelspec points somewhere else and you can't start a Python kernel, try deleting or renaming that kernelspec folder to expose the default."
