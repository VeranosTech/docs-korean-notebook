"Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple "

"practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless "
"explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to "
"guess. There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do "
"it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch. "
"Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* "
"now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. If the "
"implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are "
